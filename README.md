================

The [WSDOT mobile app](http://mobileapp-wsdot.rhcloud.com/) is an HTML5 Web application targeting WebKit based browsers. 
It contains traffic and travel information for the state of Washington. The app includes 
statewide traffic cameras and high priority travel alerts, mountain pass reports, northbound 
and southbuond Canadian border wait times, ferry schedules and alerts as well as real time 
ferry locations. It also contains many of our social media feeds.

The application is built using:

  * [Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/)
  * [mGWT - Mobile GWT](https://github.com/mgwt/mgwt)
  * [GWT-PhoneGap](https://code.google.com/p/gwt-phonegap/)
  * [GWT-Maps-V3-Api](https://github.com/branflake2267/GWT-Maps-V3-Api)
  * [GWT-HTML5-Database](https://github.com/WSDOT/gwt-html5-database) for the Web SQL database

The app is written in Java using the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse IDE</a>.

The code is not meant to illustrate best practices nor is it necessarily bug
free. It is by no means static and is actively being updated and improved upon 
as time allows.
